Current issues:

1. 

I coded my version of autoInvFwdSim in functions-WFSims-Autosomal-SexSpec.R  , calling it  autoInvFwdSimSexSpec. I am struggling especially with two points, should the average fitness be calculated across sexes  and is the multinomial draw similar now that we have two sexes (Line 316-323)... Probably not as a custom test with a ridiculously fit mutation does not fix the mutation, 

2. 
functions-WFSims-Autosomal.R: It seems to me that W.mean has two different meanings if it is in save trajerctories or not within the function autoInvFwdSim ( line 273 or 333)
