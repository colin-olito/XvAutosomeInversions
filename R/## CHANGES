## CHANGES


Change so that we have an average s and two different sm and sf from a delta ( only in the last wrapper function)
same for m  ( only in the last wrapper function)

store  mm mf and also r in the wrappers

so sbar is staying the same, but s threshold
change recode


Check where I have colin, wether it is there become 1/2N



##  parameter space

1//551

 3 AVERAGE SELECTION REMAIN THE SAME sx =0.1 then we can have sy=0 and sy = 0.2 or the 

 3 and we do that for migration again
